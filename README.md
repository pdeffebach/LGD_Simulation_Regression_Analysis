# LGD_Simulation_Regression_Analysis

This Matlab code generates a simulated LGD dataset using eith a Censored Gamma, Two Tiered Gamma, or Inflated Beta base model. Then it proceeds to run 7 kinds of regressions, with each regression producing a much larger predicted dataset. Finally, the code produces a variety of graphs and tables for assessing the predictive power of each regression type. 

All code is run out of the code client_dropping_vars.m, in which you can set all parameter values and choose the distribution type for the initial simulation. You also have to generate a figures folder and encode its location so all graphs are saved in a convenient place.
